## Sessoion 1  - iso omena

* Samer from Iraq - 4 years in Finland. Young adult.
* Juha - 60 years old 
* Even less afraid of robots after the experiment
* Eja:  wife
* Juha Feels the solution is needed. Not all pictures appeared properly light was disturing.
* Samer: exciting, new thing, fun. Speaking in Arabic and getting Arabic responses. 
* Ejas: has been talking to Pepper robot, but it couldn't understand Finnish. After figuring out the interface, it was easy to have contact with the robot.
* Samer: super easy to control the robot. 
* They could see the face gestures and assumed that they mean something, but weren't sure what.
* Juha: Felt that the pictures reflected culture, but there wasn't enough time to go sense the differences.
* Samer: People are anyway different, but only two picture choices were different "This is nice!".
* Juha: Cultural background affects interpretation of the outside world.
* Juha: Didn't have any expectations because he didn't know anything about the person. 
* Eja: All machines have a mind of their own.
* Juha: Could see just the human behind. Couldn't believe that a machine this simple has a mind.
* Samer: In the future it will be more and more. Can't judge people but can have an idea about their thoughts. In the future could be more than pictures, maybe music. More ways of expression.
* Juha: It would tell more if there was more than pictures, such as music. Can skip the pressing with the hands there was too much. 
* Eja: Touching was OK. Soft. But human touch is different. 
* Antti (organizer): First experience with soft robots, felt much warmer but not sure why. It wasn't only the touch, the whole thing.
* Eja & Juha: Would like face gestures to be more human like.
* Samer: Looks like Mosquito. Funny that you can change your shape and language.
* Samer: Felt freedom to say what you want. Maybe felt more free than in real life. 
* Eja & Juha: Wasn't scary!
* Juha: Would prefer face to face conversation, but it's good as a translation machine.  would like humans to treat him in the elderly home and not robots.



## Session 2 - VÃ¤re
Roya, Ari, Hari

Roya: First conversation with Finnish. Can be useful when traveling to a place with a language gap. Communication was slow but better than nothing. Funny to be a robot.

Hari: First is confusion but when using it becomes good.

Ari: Tranlsation is useful.
Hari: Soft robot, first a little bit strange but get used to it.
Ari: Feels nicer than a normal hardware robot. Softer. Especially if it can represent more emotion in the future. Hard to see emotion.
Roya: Up & Down arrow were interpreted as nodding. Comfortable with trying - **just laughing emoji**.
Roya: Missed spelling correction, then it'sh too late - "Something terrible has happened" it was spoken in Finnish.
Hari: Was hard to say something reasonable. In a "Real" situation it could be better.
Ari: How to speak so the robot understands, words were dropping or put together. Has to re-invent the way he's speaking. Mis-communications. When speaking together it misses parts.
Hari: Behind some wall, no idea who is on the other side.
Merja: Learned that she doesn't like pink or too romantic images.
Hari: Neutral feeling.
Ari: Knew who is speaking. Didn't learn much, didn't get deep in the conversation.
Merja: She likes grass and coffee.
Merja: The angle is problematic, maybe better to have pillows on the floor.
Roya: Not thinking about the partner, just making sure to speak right and type right.
Hari, Ari: Feels that they're talking to a person through the robot.
Ari: Maybe it can break some prejudices.
Roya: It was like a video call. 
Roya: Intuitively thought that they can also see her until I said something.
Merja: About being used in work?
Hari: The conversation stays very general considering you don't see the person.
Ari: To communicate things to show, behavior needs to be more complex, more body language. "Do it like that".
Roya: Lecturer in other language.  (Stil focusing on language..) Classrooms, learning languages. It was really good that I could hear what I wrote in Persian (active). Waiting for the translation. Somehow felt like it's me "I could hear myself" "It was not me, but can be." You don't know the language, don't feel as much miserable. 
Ari: Smile of humanoid robots is strange. Animated makes more sense.
Hari: Interesting experience, completely new to me, (changed anything?) this represents of the future in many ways, the possibilities are unlimited with this kind of system.


## Themes

Awe and respect, lots of patience, at least on the outside. Gradually getting used to the interface. 
Reaction to gaze.


## Theme subsections

quotes,
pictures

### Pre-conception of robots.

I-1-a: (Translation): "He wasn't afraid in the beginning, and now is even less afraid of robots."

I-1-a: (Translation): "They didn't have any pre thoughts."

But why did you even say that.
Untranslated material: 
 Juha: Would prefer face to face conversation, but it's good as a translation machine.  would like humans to treat him in the elderly home and not robots.
 Specified age in the beginning.  Perhaps some fear exists.

 I-2-b: "This represents of the future in many ways. The possibilities are unlimited, I think with this kind of system".


### Perception of HITODAMA

As translation machine.

"He cannot thing that there is a machine with a mind, it was human behind it".
But then what is all this fear of robots.

I-2: "Use the system" utilitarian.

The translator functions turned it into a translation machine.

ASo much screen based, interrupting the touch. Feels more 

I-3-b: "I see the hands and I see the face but there is so much stuff..cluttering my vision..it was so much screen based that it wasn't like I'm looking at the eyes that much like actually looking by the thing through the screen so much..that it feels more like an interaction device than even as a kind of a robot".

I-4: "It was difficult to focus on the actual robot as a person because I was constantly having to twist my  head to see the sort of status of that stuff".

I-4: "Sometimes I was looking at the camera, sometimes I was looking at the eyes, which logically doesn't make any sense..once in a while when speech would come through I would sort of focus on the face and figure out that this guy is talking" 
(Again this liminality!)

I-5: Would prefer the screen up and not down 
(didn't see it as part of the body)
(In another case C-4 suggested to have it integrated into the body)

### Use of touch
I-1-b:Easy, gradually leoarning.
I-1-a: Touching could be skipped (fear of robot?). Touch between humans is different.

I-1-b: "First a little bit strange but I think you get used to do it pretty fast"
I-1-a: "Feels nicer than a normal hard robot. It's softer."

I-3-b: "That's definitely something that I haven't had before and it's cool...then you start to kind of have a little bit of different kind of relationship".

I-3-a: "I think it makes you behave differently that there's this creature that you need to touch and talk to, because of this was a screen and a keyboard I think the communication would become very different, so I think it does change the way you approach."

I-4 moved to use the mouse because was afraid of choosing the wrong.
(Lot's of fear of being mis-understood),

I-5-a: Doesn't understand why touching is needed, and not just click. Would have preferred to click. The interface distracted me from what I'm used to doing.

I-5-b: If it was equal. "As if the robot is them and they have the robot of me, then it could work." If you could handshake and do other kind of human interactions, then it could be something that might be very interesting. 


### About soft robotics
Antti (1): "This was my first experience with soft robotics and it felt, compared to other solutions, really different and warmer. Much warmer then, you know, all the other robots, but I'm not sure why was it."
Me: "You mean the soft material"
Antti: "It may be the whole thing, not only that, touch."


### Imagining of scenarios
When you travel and don't have time to learn a new language.
More ways of interaction other than pictures.

Lecturer, presentation, classrooms, when there is a language barrier.

C-5: Imagining for office work.

### Novelty

C-1: "It's new thing for me to talk through a machine".
Is it really? What about phones?

I-2-b: "Interesting experience, completely new to me."

I-3-b: "It is a very strange, like different way to communicate".


### Understanding of expressions.
(Translated): "They acknowledge that the face gestures were moving but they couldn't know what's the meaning of that. They acknowledge that there are meanings."

"They would like to have a little more human-like face gestures"

"If it can represent more emotions in the future then it's reflecting more of what people are saying".

Use up arrow and down arrow, was interpreted as nodding. 
(But doesn't look like she meant it).

I-3-a: "Is there a specific meaning to the, like, balloon effect?"
I-3-a: "Robot felt more lively, but I couldn't really tell what"
(Like an animal)

Trying to get the pattern.

I-3-b: "Make it a little bit more face-like, just a little bit would maybe add...I would maybe keep this under humanoid quality of this thing..Just a little mouth maybe"

C-4: "I don't know how that face looks like when I press the smile"
I-4: "I can see it moving and you notice that something came out..like pushed the face, but I didn't notice different expressions"

I-4: "I'd see that the expressions were happening, but then I couldn't figure out which..I mean one was really pushing up somehow, that seemed like a smile."

C-4: Work more on the expressions.

I-5: Couldn't see any expressions, were perhaps focused too much on the screen. But they could see dancing.

### Pictures as cultural exchange.
(Translated): "The scale was so limited so he thinks that there might not appear huge differences"
But more time would help.

C-1: "This is nice. I think we just choose two pictures that were different, the others were the same."

"We didn't get that deep in the conversation".

Doesn't like pink, too romantic, likes grass and coffee.

More choices.

I-3-a: Works as a conversation starter.

I-4: Was too structural and broken. bits and pieces, turn taking.
Thought that it's leading psychology, not sure what to choose.

### Reflecting on bias
I-1: "People at the bottom are the same"
I-1: "He didn't have any expectations because it was in vain...there is no need to have any back thoughts..cause he couldn't know anything."
He did know he was Arab.

I-2-b: "No, she stayed completely behind some wall. I had no idea who's on the other side."
I'm trying to convince that there is some image
"Pretty neutral,no personal minds".

I-2-a: "Maybe it can be so that it breaks some prejudices or something, because you are not interacting with the person face to face".

I-3-b: Saw her back, but couldn't get rid of that image.
I-3-a: Felt the same as having conversation online.

I-4: "This is a very weird way to form a picture of somebody in your mind".

I-5-a: Constructing something from bits of information.

I-5-b: "I do like the fact that..you know you don't have biases..whenever we meet anybody, we see them. We always have our own biases already, and this way it's like, you don't have a bias. You have no idea who's on the other side of it...You don't have that same form of censorship also."
(Does she mean visual bias based on the person's appearance?)


### Re-embodiment:
C-1: "It was funny. I could change my language" 
"I can feel I'm inside it and I can do what I want and say what I want, and moving" (saying excitedly)
Me: "But as in like more free as you would for example, be now because you are kind of behind the robot "
"Yeah, not quite sure, maybe, maybe yes maybe no."
"Did you feel that you can share anything with the.."
"Maybe yes, yeah."

C-2: "It was funny...I didn't feel anything strange or weird, I was really comfortable."

Basically everyone:
Just laughing zaemojis - ownership.


C-2: "It was interesting..maybe I could say that I could hear myself, you know? it was not me, but can be...You don't know the language, but it feels like you know it, so you don't feel that much miserable.


C-3: "I couldn't get any feedback about the interaction between you and the robot, only camera, I can guess you are shaking hands..so I couldn't get the situation here..but I tried to move this robot more because this is the only way to communicate instead of words. Translation is a bit slow so I feel like maybe I should act like a human.
(Using I pronoun)


C-3: "About this mirror, I tried to see myself because I wanted to check how I look like, so I wanted to use this mirror more but unfortunately it's not clearly shown"

(Nobody asked to interact with the mirror).

Typing was slower than they are speaking directly, made her feel uncomfortable.
C-3: "Typing in Japanese, this gives me another impression. Normally I answer in English like this, but writing back in Japanese was fun because I also expect how it will be translated, sometimes it's wrong, sometimes it's correct."

(Me): The neck was having some issues. It was wearing down. Fatigue..

C-4: "It was a bit hard to understand which way the camera will move when I press the buttons. It was confusing, so I didn't feel in charge that much."
C-4: "Not knowing how these expressions look like exactly to the person I am speaking at that time (was hard)."

C-5: It was so nice, many languages. Laughing
(So there was some enjoyment to the asymmetry).



### Incarnation
I-1: "It wasn't scary" 
Why were you supposed to be scare?
* Juha: Would prefer face to face conversation, but it's good as a translation machine.  would like humans to treat him in the elderly home and not robots.

I-2b: "At first it was pretty hard to create something reasonable to say, but in a real situation of course it could be deeper"
Angle of the cameradd

I-2a: "How to speak so it understands what I'm saying, it was dropping words or putting them together the way I'm speaking normally so you have to re-invent the way I'm speaking so it says what I'm saying."
Speaking together was problematic

I-2: "I had a idea that we're talking to person".
"Just through the robot"

I-2-b: (In regards to being used in work life) "I think the conversation might be staying in a very general level because you don't see the person you're dealing with".

I-2-a: "On my line of work, if I needed something to communicate like that, it has to be much more complex so it can animate things I need to show people"

I-3-b: "It was really interesting the moment I stepped here and it started to move (Illustrating getting the shivers) and then someone said that there is someone inside or something like that, you maybe said that? and those things when they came, I was having such a black mirror moment, like there is someone there, really it was like this tickling really eerie thing to think that way, that there is someone inside there (Illustrating disgust). But..it was much more peaceful than I maybe expected it to be and it didn't have gestured that much than I was maybe expecting it to be from the first."

(Abjection?)

I-3-b: "Still I was basically seeing someone is there behind of that, actually I'm just trying to communicate through this thing, more than this is a person."

(Me) There seems to be an in-between space, liminal? Between mediating device and agent. You know you're also talking to it. Seems to trigger some different approach or behavior.

I-3-b: "The most somehow human or somehow vulnerability that it showed was maybe when it kind of lowered the arms like this (Showing), especially because to me it looks like it's..wrists open..as a gesture..I'm in your use..opening up your wrists as a gesture... I don't have anything to hide..I'm serving..so that was like a noble moment".

I-3-a: Translation is clunky so you rather try to communicate something simple. 
Taking turns.
Cross-speaking.
(I then added a typing indicator).
But usually control was pretty well.

The gazing did work , they didn't really notice the camera.

I-4: Would like more feedback when things are received properly, expecting tactile feedback.

I-4: "If I say something jokingly...it will be taken as literal text and you won't see my sarcastic face."
(Even though he should have known he is being filmed, but perhaps this feeling of submitting texts makes him forget that it's being looked at. And the asymmetry).

### Conversation hurdles

C-2: "I was more worried about doing it well and just to concentrate so I didn't focus on who they are and what are they talking about, I was just taking care of typing" (She was worried of misspelling and mistranslation).

I-3-a: "There's no way to take anything back..I just said that"
I-3-b:  You have to wait to what the other one is saying before you say you didn't mean that
(Why turn taking?)

C-3: Switched to output English because in Finnish I don't know what I did say
(1st person again!)

C-4: Switched to input English rather than Turkish because thought it sounds better.
I-4: Time was too short and then it came out wrong.

Confused not knowing that speaking sends immediately.

I-4: Felt like submitting a response. 

I-4 and C-4: Conscious of the translation happening, like speaking to Siri.

I-5-a: Expected miss-understandings but it was OK. It was a bit like talking to Google Translate
(again!)



### Issues of asymmetry

C-2: "Because I was able to see them it was like that they can see me... If you didn't mention that, I couldn't figure out that they can't see me."

C-3: "I feel weird in the beginning because you can't see my face but you look at the eyes of this robot, so I can see your eyes watching me by camera, so in the beginning I feel a bit shy..It was like actual communication for me because your eyes were looking at me."
(Probably she felt shy because she can see them).

C-3: "I hesitate to speak about my personal story but somehow..it's really difficult to start conversation only by picture..you can't see me..even using robot I still feel shy"

Almost same as in the real life.

"(In real life) I can be more fluent in body language and also speaking. Using robot is a bit clumsy communication so I get a bit more shy."

I-3-a: "It was...at first hard to tell how much you see from us, like I guess you saw and heard all the time what were were saying...I wasn't quite sure how much we need to interface through"

Thought it was symmetrical, were surprised she answered without them using the interface.
(How could they have ignored the camera microphone, and me saying that?)

C-5: "I felt like I am working in the government and I am the general and you are the guys like doing something wrong or something like that, I'm talking to you and then I see what's up and what you are doing".

I-5-a: "Did you see us?"

C-5: "I do see you."

I-5-b: "Oh!"

I-5-a: "Because we didn't see you."

C-5: "I see you and it's like, I see everything but you don't see anything."

I-5-a: "Yeah. We noticed that there is a camera and we realized that we're being videoed."

C-5: "And also I hear you."

I-5-b: "Ohh. OK."

C-5: "No one will accept I see you and you don't see me. "

I-5-a: "Exactly."

C-5: "Like no one. Even when I am coming for example now **in** the government....Someone should come to talk to me. Like now, is not before. Before we was having Assad, you know, the dictator...So like, you should do this. But now everyone like need to see, need to understand what's going on, for example on this phone."

Me: "So you would prefer if they see you?"

C-5: "Of course".

Me: "I think the idea is also that some people don't want to be seen, and they prefer to have like this kind of avatar".

I-5-b: "But in that case I feel like you have to make it both sides, where both of the individuals can't see each other or hear each other and the only way of communicating is through something like this."

C-5: "I wanna talk about like for example between Israel and Palestine let's say. This case might be work...Palestine...one guy for example..cannot show his self to this government or these guys..For example I cannot show my face to you, because when I talk to you, might be you will know me and danger is for me. "
