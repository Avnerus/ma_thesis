Inroduction
===========
This is a small introduction. It is automatically included in the table of contents. Furthermore we can do some bullet points:

* First topic
* Second topic


Formulas
--------
It also works withou formulas[^1], but they are simple to use, and they look very beautiful.
$$m = \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$

[^1]: You dont have to use them if you don't want to.

Tables
------
Tables are also possible. And they look awesome.

Definitions
-----------
It is obvious that defnitions are good [@ahmed_cultural_2014].
Yeah they are [@ahmed_cultural_2014]
Lets make some simple definitions - and of course, these can occur everywhere in the document.

Triangle
  : A plane figure that has three straight bounding sides. There are also triagles with a 90 degree angle: $c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$

Quadrilateral
  : A plane figure that has four straight bounding sides.

Square
  : A rhombus that is a rectangle.
